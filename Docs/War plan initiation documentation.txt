Factors that influence AI war planning initiative.
I won't go into detail about the more complex things that an xml modders don't need to know much about.

Funding:
 ♦ An estimated expense increase percentage is included when evaluating if funding is healthy enough for war planning.
•• ♠ ESTIMATED_EXTRA_WAR_EXPENSE_PERCENT (EEWEP) (default 12)
•• ♣ When GAMEOPTION_NO_REVOLUTION is turned off, when revolution is an active mechanic:
•••• EEWEP = 1.25 * EEWEP, meaning default is pushed up from 12 to 15.
•••• This becuase war is financially more risky where revolution may happen due to poor finance.
•••• Translates to slightly more careful AI when revolution mechanic is active in game.
•• ♥ The resulting EEWEP value is used as is for "total war" planning;
•••• for limited war it is divided by 2 (=6/7);
•••• for dogpile war planning it is divided by 3 (=4/5).
 ♦ The safe funding value threshold depends on several factors, I won't go into details on numbers here, 
•• just know that the safe funding level is not always the same in each case.
•• e.g. 60% funded may be considered safe for one AI to plan wars on, while another needs perhaps 65% funding to consider it safe.
 ♦ With my recent changes, funding requirement is much less strict than it was.

War plan abandonment:
 ♦ If funding goes below safe level, and war plan has existed for X amount of turns.
•• ♠ X scaled by gamespeed
•• ♣ X scaled by size of the funding gap, bigger funding gap means less turns into plan before abandonment may happen.
•• ♥ Limited war plans are abandoned at lower X value than total war plans are, limited war plans are supposed to quickly lead to war, while total war plans need longer planning phase.
 ♦ Dogpile war plans are abandoned if victim is no longer at war with anyone, dogpile is all about joining another war.

Note:
 ♦ In general, the AI won't prepeare war plans if already at war or if already preparing a warplan agains any AI.
•• The exception to that is if the combined power of all enemies the AI is at war with or planning war against is less than 45% of its own power, then it may start to prepare war on someone else.
•• There are some secondary reasons that will trigger warplaning, like rejecting a diplomatic demand from an AI.
•• AI may also suddenly declare war in some cases without a prepared warplan.
 ♦ GAMEOPTION_AGGRESSIVE_AI will make all AI plan war as if they were actively pursuing the domination victory condition.
 
Consider starting a war plan code section:
 ♦ Before even cosidering to start a war plan, the iAIDeclareWarProb from handicap info needs to random roll true.
•• If this value is "100" it will always roll true, and at "0" it will never roll true.
 ♦ Leader tags iMaxWarRand, iLimitedWarRand, and iDogpileWarRand are likelyhoods for starting war plans of the different types.
•• ♠ iMaxWarRand is used for total war plan random roll.
•• ♣ The xml value itself is just a base, it is modified by AI strategy and situation, so a derived value is used in the random roll.
•• ♥ Higher value means less likely to start a war plan each turn.
 ♦ If funding for total war is ok, it will do a random roll on total war, if the roll fails it will do the roll for limited war, if that fails it will do the roll for dogpile war.
 ♦ The different war plans have slightly different conditions to initiate even after a succsessful warRand roll, this is mostly about power ratios and strategical priorities.
 ♦ There is one factor of importance to an xml modder after a successful WarRand roll.
•• ♠ The NoWarAttitudeProbs leader tag, higher values means less likely to start war plan on a player that you have this or that attitude towards
•••• A value of 100 means the AI won't even consider planning war on a player it has this attitude towards, unless it is endgame situation and domination/conquest strategies reduces the xml value by a certain amount.
•••• A Value of 130 would in most cases make the AI not plan war on a player if it has that attitude with it, unless you play with Aggressive AI.
•••• A value of 140 will stop any war plans with Aggressive AI, so the option is not super impactful in this regard; it only subtract 10 from the NoWarAttitudeProbs value.
•••• Ruthless AI option has a huge impact though, you would need a value of 300 to avoid AI from planning war on their best friends.
•••• With both options only a value of 310 will stop AI from planning war on a player it has that attitude with.
