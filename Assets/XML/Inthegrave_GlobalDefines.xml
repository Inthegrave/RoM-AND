		Toffer - At 100, if the unit performing the volley has the same effective strength as the victim, then the victim would suffer 1/3 of its max health.
			Higher value means more damage (can be considered a percentage), at 25 the damage would be about 1/12 of its max health.
			If victim is relatively stronger to the unit performing the volley then it will take less damage, and vice versa.
			Defense modifiers reduce damage dealt to a unit by a volley, but base strength is more significant than the adjusted strength from defense modifiers.
